[Cookiecutter] template for a Machine Learning project in Python,
based on the [Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter] by [Claudio Jolowicz]
as well as the [Data Science Cookiecutter] by [DrivenData].

This is a _very opinionated_ template, designed to guide the user
in creating a ML project that will be easy to test, maintain, update
and deploy.

## Usage

```console
$ cookiecutter gh:mdsach/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python-ml \
  --checkout=""
```
